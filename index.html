			<p>Hi! I'm Charlotte, welcome to my retro website. It's inspired by the personal websites people made in the early days of the internet :)</br>
			<br>I like to make all sorts of arts and crafts, so I thought a custom website I wrote myself in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would be the perfect way to display them. I hope to add more things to the page
			in the future, but for now I have some wood carvings, embroidery projects, and a little JavaScript game to play.</br>
			<br>I hope you enjoy your stay here!</br>
